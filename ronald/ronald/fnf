  <h1>Friday Night Funkin'</h1>
  <p>Friday Night Funkin' is a game...</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371">NEWGROUNDS game page</a> here you can play the game with the original 7 weeks, week 7 will remain an exclusive to newgrounds for a while so play it here!<br>
    <a href="https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin">itch.io game page</a> here you can play up till week 6 and download the game, this is a worse version because of the many changes week 7 brought to the engine.<br>
    With the downloaded version you can play mods, which allow for custom charts and fixes to the engine made by the community.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>All jokes aside, this game is pretty fun. The community might be cringe, but that doesn't really matter.<br>
